# Investigating the Effect of Catch-Bond Formation at the PDZ Domain of Junctional Protein Afadin under Mechanical Stress

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding the effect of catch-bond formation at the PDZ domain of the junctional protein Afadin under mechanical stress.

## Contributions

- Conducted Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations replicating the stress conditions that cell junctions face in biological conditions.
- Calculated probable free energy pathways in the event of catch-bond formation.
