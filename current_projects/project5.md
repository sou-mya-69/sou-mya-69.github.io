# Investigating How Biophysical Constraints of Foldability Shaped the Early Selection of Amino Acids in the Pre-Cellular World

## Overview

This project delves into understanding how biophysical constraints of foldability shaped the early selection of amino acids in the pre-cellular world.

## Contributions

- Created a comprehensive dataset of peptide sequences and structures by utilizing ESMFold, an AI model from META.
- Developed a new dataset of proteins with modifications in the peptide sequences to investigate their effects on folding.
