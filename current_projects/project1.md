# Investigation of the Origins of Immunomodulatory Drugs-Resistance in Myeloma Patients

## Overview

In collaboration with Mayo Clinic, this project focuses on understanding the origins of immunomodulatory drug resistance in myeloma patients using Molecular Dynamics simulations.

## Contributions

- Developed hypotheses on the potential point of failures of existing drugs due to particular mutations and deletions in the substrate receptor of E3-ligase.
- Generated models to accurately depict the deletions in E3-Ligase.
- Identified a conformationally-coupled disassembly pathway of the deformed E3-Ligase system from large-scale MD simulations.
