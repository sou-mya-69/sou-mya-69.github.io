# Molecular Targeting of Cholangiocarcinoma - Overcoming Drug-Resistive Mutations

## Overview

In collaboration with Mayo Clinic, this project focuses on molecular targeting of Cholangiocarcinoma with the goal of overcoming drug-resistive mutations.

## Contributions

- Designed models and simulations to investigate the molecular reasons for the failure of existing drugs.
- Explored the molecular characteristics of existing pharmaceuticals through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
- Incorporated insights from MD simulations into the pharmacophore modeling of extensive drug libraries to overcome mutations.

## Collaborators

- Mayo Clinic
