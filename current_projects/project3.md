# Mechanistic Investigations into Polymodal Activation of Human TRPV1

## Overview

This project involves conducting mechanistic investigations into the polymodal activation of human TRPV1 by heat, protons, and ligands. The aim is to elucidate the distinctions in their allosteric pathways.

## Contributions

- Designed coarse-grained simulations and normal mode analysis calculations to determine probable pathways for allosteric changes in the TRPV1 channel.
- Identified suitable small molecules with the potential to activate the proton and heat-decoupled allosteric changes, intending to minimize side effects.
